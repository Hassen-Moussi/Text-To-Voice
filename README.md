# Text-To-Voice

This project integrates Python and React to create a web application that converts text into speech. The Python backend processes the text input and generates audio output, while the React frontend provides a user-friendly interface for inputting text and selecting language options. This seamless combination of technologies allows users to easily transform written content into spoken words.
